# Team and Collaboration Guide

This guide explains how multiple people should work together on the same repository.

## Steps

### Step 1: Clone the repository
Each team member should clone the repository to their system.

```git clone <repository-url>```

---

### Step 2: Create a new branch
Create a separate branch before starting work.

```git checkout -b feature-branch```

---

### Step 3: Work on your task
Make changes only related to your assigned task.

---

### Step 4: Add and commit changes
Save your work with a clear commit message.

```
git add .
git commit -m "Added new feature"
```

---

### Step 5: Push your branch to GitHub
Upload your branch to GitHub.

```git push origin feature-branch
```

---

### Step 6: Create a Pull Request
Open GitHub and create a Pull Request to merge your branch into `main`.

---

### Basic Collaboration Rules
- Do not work directly on the `main` branch
- One task = one branch
- Write clear commit messages
- Review code before merging
